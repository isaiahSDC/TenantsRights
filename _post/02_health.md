# Tenants Rights for Health & Safety

Contact the landlord in writing– a work order or a demand letter. 

Make sure to document: take pictures, write down dates and concerns, record when you contacted the landlord, By-Law, etc.

If it is an “emergency” and you cannot reach the landlord, contact By-Law or Fire Prevention as appropriate.

- **Immediate Hazarde**: Sprinkler or electrical system, fire exits blocked, (smoke) alarms not working
  - Contact [LINK] *Fire Prevention* if not resolved in 24 hours

- **Other Concerns**: Minor obstructions to exits, damaged hall or stair lighting / emergency lighting, poor fitting or damaged doors / ceilings / walls.
  -   Make sure that you have sent a written request to the property management. If the problem is not solved in two weeks contact Fire Prevention.
  -  **Fire Prevention will come to inspect the issue.**
      -  It will request repairs to be done by the property management in a certain period. Afterwards, it will take legal action.

# Tenants Rights for Maintenance & Repairs

Contact the landlord in writing– a work order or a demand letter. 

Make sure to document: take pictures, write down dates and concerns, record when you contacted the landlord, By-Law, etc.

If it is an “emergency” and you cannot reach the landlord, contact By-Law or Fire Prevention as appropriate.

- **Essential Service**: (e.g. hot water, heating, sewage)
  - Contact [LINK] *By-Law* if not resolved in 24 hours

- **Non-essential Service**: 
  -  Make sure that you have sent a written request to the property management. If the problem is not solved in two weeks contact city By-Law.
  -  **An inspector comes within a week in the case of a “non-essential” issue.**
      - By-Law will issue a repair order to be completed by the landlord within a minimum of 19 days. If the issue is not fixed within that time, By-Law will contract someone to do the work or lay a charge against the property management.

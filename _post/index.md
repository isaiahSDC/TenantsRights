# Tenant's Rights Enforcements Information Page

The Waterloo Region covers a vast variety of living arrangements, and this information is intended to cover any issues that may occur as tenants. 

Always be responsible in keeping your unit in good state and ALWAYS report issues in a TIMELY manner! Documenting concerns is the key â€“ if not sure how to document, get in touch with a tenant support group, R.E.N.T. Renters Educating and Networking Together or the Waterloo Region Community Legal Services.

## Categories for Tenant issues

- **[LINK] Maintenance & Repairs** : (water, sewer, hot water & heating, insects, mold, appliances, noise, etc.)
- **[LINK] Health & Safety** : (fire alarms , fire exits, electrical systems, safety hazards, etc.)
- **[LINK] Crime & Security** : (theft, vandalism, drugs, violence, etc.)

Each of the services keeps their own case records and can testify at Landlord & Tenant Board Hearings.
